### 使用vite遇到的问题
vite+vue npm run dev时报错

```
Make sure you don't have "ignore-scripts" set to true. You can check this with
"npm config get ignore-scripts". If that returns true you can reset it back to
false using "npm config set ignore-scripts false" and then reinstall esbuild.

If you're using npm v7, make sure your package-lock.json file contains either
"lockfileVersion": 1 or the code "hasInstallScript": true. If it doesn't have
either of those, then it is likely the case that a known bug in npm v7 has
corrupted your package-lock.json file. Regenerating your package-lock.json file
should fix this issue.
